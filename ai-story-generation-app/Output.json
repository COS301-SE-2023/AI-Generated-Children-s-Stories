            "text": "Once upon a time, there was a happy little boy named Jake. Jake loved to move his body and play games that made him strong. Every morning, he would wake up and do some stretching to warm up his muscles. Then he would go outside and ride his bike, run around the park, or jump on his trampoline. Jake knew that exercise made him feel good and gave him lots of energy to explore the world around him. He loved being active and playing with his friends. "
